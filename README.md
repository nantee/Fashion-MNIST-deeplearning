# **Fashion MNIST Deep learning**
Train a deep Convolutional neural network to classify Zalandoâ€™s article images with keras. In general, the color is probably irrelevant when distinquishing different types of clothes since they vary substantially in many clothingtypes. Shape however is relevant and therefor a grayscale is set in the beginning eliminating any problem the RGB dimensions might add to the CNN's featuremapping. In some cases emblems on a t-shirt for example might add unnecessary information, no effort was put in regarding removal of theses emblems, but it could definitely be considered.


## Dependencies
* tensorflow
* keras
* pandas
* numpy
* mathplotlib

## Example 
15 example modelpredictions displaying the CNN's performance with title coloring (green = correct, red = non-correct).
