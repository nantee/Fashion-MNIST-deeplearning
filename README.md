# **Fashion MNIST Deep learning**
Train a deep Convolutional neural network to classify Zalandoâ€™s article images with keras. In general, the color is irrelevant to distinquish different sorts of clothingtypes. Shape however is relevant, therefor a grayscale is set in the beginning eliminating any problem the RGB dimensions might add to the featuremapping in the convolutional layers.


## Dependencies
* tensorflow
* keras
* pandas
* numpy
* mathplotlib

## Example 
15 example modelpredictions displaying the CNN's performance with title coloring (green = correct, red = non-correct).
